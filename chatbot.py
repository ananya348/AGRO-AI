# Krishi Sakhi - AI Farming Assistant (Python Terminal Version)
#
# Description:
# This script implements a conversational AI chatbot for farmers. It uses multiple PDF documents
# as a knowledge base, understands both English and Malayalam queries through text or voice,
# and responds in the same language, also via text and voice.
#
# Author: Gemini
# Date: September 11, 2025

# --- Installation ---
# Before running, you need to install the required Python libraries.
# Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
# pip install google-generativeai python-dotenv speechrecognition pyaudio pdfplumber gtts playsound langdetect

import os
import google.generativeai as genai
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import speech_recognition as sr
import pdfplumber
from gtts import gTTS
from playsound import playsound
from langdetect import detect, LangDetectException

# --- Configuration ---
# 1. Create a file named ".env" in the same directory as this script.
# 2. Inside the .env file, add your Google API Key like this:
#    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
# 3. This script will automatically load the key.

load_dotenv()
API_KEY = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")

if not API_KEY:
    print("Error: GOOGLE_API_KEY not found. Please create a .env file and add your API key.")
    exit()

genai.configure(api_key=API_KEY)
